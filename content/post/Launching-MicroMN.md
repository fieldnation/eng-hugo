# The New Minnesota Microservice Community.

We're excited to announce the launch of MicroMN. Field Nation invites
Minnesota high-tech companies and talent to build a local community to share
and learn about microservice transformations, technologies, and architecture.
Please visit the [official press release here](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-2155917.htm) or visit the
[MicroMN Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/MicroMN/) to RSVP.
